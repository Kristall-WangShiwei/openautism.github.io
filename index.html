    <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a range of developmental disorders that cause social, communication, and behavioral challenges or impairment along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.1,3  Affecting 1 in 592 children in the United States, ASD is usually apparent in the first 5 years of life and can persist into adolescence and adulthood, often in combination with other conditions such as epilepsy, sleep issues, depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.1,3</p>
    <p>The cause of ASD hasn’t been definitively determined,5 and parents, care teams, and clinicians struggle to develop, maintain, and evolve care plans for children and adults with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorders manifest and affect different children in different ways and to varying degrees. Signs and symptoms are difficult to capture and measure, leading to multitudes of unique treatments, therapies, and management for each child’s situation.</p>
